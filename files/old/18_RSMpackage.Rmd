## Setting up a CCD with `ccd`

![CCD Summary](figures/ccd_summary.png)

```{r}
ccd(y ~ x1 + x2, n0=c(5,0), 
    alpha="rotatable", randomize=FALSE, oneblock=TRUE)
```
A CCD can be split into blocks. The most common split is two blocks:

* Block 1: Factorial points + center points
* Block 2: Axial points + center points

```{r}
ccd(y ~ x1 + x2, n0=c(4,4), 
    alpha="rotatable", randomize=FALSE, oneblock=FALSE)
```
For uniform precision, the total number of center points must equal or exceed the recommend number. In practice, the center points are split equally, with a few extra center points added to both blocks.

It is also possible to split a CCD into three blocks. All the axial points remain in one block, and the factorial core is split into two. Center points are added to each block.

## Example: Optimizing the yield of a chemical reaction

Time varies from 80 - 90 minutes (-1 to 1)
Temp varies from 170 - 180 C (-1 to 1)

The coded variable $$x$$ can be calculated using the original variable $$\xi$$ and the original values at +1 ($$\xi_{+1}$$) and -1 ($$\xi_{-1}$$).

$$ x = \frac{\xi - \mathrm{mean}(\xi_{+1},\xi_{-1})}{(\xi_{+1} - \xi_{-1})/2} $$

```{r}
react <- ccd(Yield ~ x1 + x2,
             n0 = c(3,3),
             randomize=FALSE,
             alpha="rotatable",
             coding = list(x1 ~ (Time - 85)/5,
                           x2 ~ (Temp - 175)/5))
react
```
```{r}
varfcn(react, ~ SO(x1,x2))
```

```{r}
varfcn(react, ~ SO(x1,x2), contour=TRUE)
```

Let's add the measured yield data.

```{r}
react$Yield <- c(80.5, 82.0, 81.5, 83.5, 83.9, 84.3, 84.0,
                 75.6, 78.4, 77.0, 78.5, 79.7, 79.8, 79.5)
react
```

Fitting a FO+TWI model using the first 7 runs (FF + 3 CPs)

```{r}
react_first <- react[1:7, ]
FOreact <- rsm(Yield ~ FO(x1,x2) + TWI(x1,x2), data=react_first)
summary(FOreact)
```

```{r}
SOreact <- rsm(Yield ~ Block + SO(x1,x2), data=react)
summary(SOreact)
xs(SOreact)
```

## Visualizing the results

```{r}
contour(SOreact, x1 ~ x2, image=TRUE)
```

```{r}
persp(SOreact, x1 ~ x2, contour=TRUE, zlab="Yield")
```
